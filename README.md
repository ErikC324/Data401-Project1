# Data401-Project1

The code to aggregate our data, merge our external datasets, and build / analyze our two models is written in a Jupyter notebook where each cell can be ran in sequence.

To run the cells you will need the following datasets which we will provide in the project folder:
- Iowa Liquor Sales (Not provided according to instructions)
- Election Data (usa-2016-presidential-election-by-county.csv)
- Iowa Unemployment (iowa_unemployment.csv)

You will also need the following libraries
- uszipcode (on Jupyter server, !pip install --user uszipcode line is needed)
- pandas
- numpy
- random

All of the cells should run in sequence and will build and analyze the models.
